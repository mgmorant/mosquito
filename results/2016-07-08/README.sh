# Now we run the processes on a loop to map the reads with Bowtie2.
# The first time we made the mapping wasn't very successful so in this time we decided to make a local alignment.
# Also we  processed the unassembled reads like if they were pair-ends but the mapping was not good again, so
# finally we decided to process the reads, assembled and unassembled, as independent ones. The rationale
# is that if reads map better with local alignment than with a global one (presumably due to
# many reads being chimeric), they will also map better as single ends than as paired ends, even
# if they are paired in nature.
#
# This introduces the problem of the names. Paired reads have the same name in the fastq files, only
# distinguished by the second word of the name line in the fastq format. Only the first word is retained
# in the sam output. Thus, two paired reads would appear in sam as having two primary alignments, if
# bowtie2 allows for two reads with the same name at all.
#
# The natural thing to do is to change the names of the second reads. One option is to use bbreformat.sh,
# from the bbmap package. This program allows to add ' /1' and ' /2' to the names of the reads. But that
# does not help, because of the white space. Another option is to substitute spaces by underscores in the
# names.
#
# It is desirable to run in parallele no only the mapping but also the re-writing of the fastq files
# and the post-mapping creation of the bam file. Thus, it is best to outsource the processing of each
# sample to a different script, that we can call from here.
#
# Note that the execution of the auxiliary script is made conditional on the non-existence of the final
# bam output, so that intermediate files, such as the created fastq files and the sam files can be deleted.
